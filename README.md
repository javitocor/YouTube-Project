# YouTube-Project
A fake clone of YouTube

# What it does?
It was the first exercise of the Microverse full time course. The goal was to replicate 
YouTube visually, without the functionality.

# Built with
HTML & CSS

# Live demo
*Tried to use RawGitHack but got an error 404. Please  help us figure it out.

# Getting started
Clone repo from Github... But seriously, who would want to?

# Credit
Special thanks to our reviewer Oluwcdamilare for congratulating us on such an ugly 
clone and guiding us to make it better!
